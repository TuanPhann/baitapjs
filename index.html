    <p id="text">Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. Don't call me a
        mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What
        plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there! I'm going to regret this. There goes another one.
        Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited. That's funny, the damage doesn't
        look as bad from out here. Are you sure this things safe? Close up formation. You'd better let her loose. Almost
        there! I can't hold them! It's away! It's a hit! Negative. Negative! It didn't go in. It just impacted on the
        surface. Red Leader, we're right above you. Turn to point... oh-five, we'll cover for you. Stay there... I just
        lost my starboard engine. Get set to make your attack run. The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
        Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no
        transmissions. Aaah....This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission. If this is a consular ship...were
        is the Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I
        want her alive! There she is! Set for stun! She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner. What a
        piece of junk. She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it
        where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry
        aboard we'll get out of here. Hello, sir. Which way? All right, men. Load your weapons! Stop that ship! Blast
        'em! Chewie, get us out of here! Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel. Run, Luke! Run!</p> -->

        Bài 1: kết quả là undifine và 2, vì thằng var a và thằng declaration
        function đều có hoisting
      </li>
      <li>
        Bài 2: kết quả bằng 5 vì thằng a được gán lại bằng 5 nên khi hàm dc gọi
        thì biến a global đã bằng 5
      </li>
      <li>
        Bài 3: kết quả là (Aurelio De Rosa) và (John Doe) : kết quả của log đầu
        tiên là this chỉ đơn giản là truy cập tới ngử cảnh thực thi của nó thôi
        (tức là thằng prop), kết quả thứ 2 là vì thằng test nó dc gán lại là
        function của thằng getFullname nên nó tạo ra một scope với ngử cảnh thực
        thi là window lúc này window có một biến fullname this.full name sẽ lấy
        value của biến fullname ngoài window
